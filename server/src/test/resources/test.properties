# --- Test Database (MySQL) ---
# Override the database URL to point to your empty test database
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test_pos?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true

# --- Hibernate Test Properties ---
# Override hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto to 'create-drop'
# This is CRITICAL for testing:
# 1. It builds your database schema from @Entity classes when tests start.
# 2. It runs your tests.
# 3. It drops (deletes) the entire schema when tests finish.
# This ensures every test run is 100% clean and isolated.
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop

# Override show_sql to 'false' to keep your test logs clean.
# You can set this to 'true' if you need to debug a specific test query.
hibernate.show_sql=true

# All other properties (jwt.secret, supervisor.emails, etc.)
# will be inherited from the main db.properties file.
